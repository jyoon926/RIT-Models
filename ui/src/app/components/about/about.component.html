    <h1>About</h1>
    <h3 class="left">
        Models @ RIT is a platform that connects photographers and aspiring models at RIT. Photography students often struggle to find models for their assignments and projects, while many students aspire to become models but lack the connections to do so.

    <h3 class="right">
        This website makes it easy for both photographers and models to connect. Any student with an rit.edu email can create a profile as a model, providing an opportunity to be seen and allowing photographers to use the site as a resource for discovering new faces.

                <b>Jacob Yoon, BS Computer Science '25</b><br><br>
                Jacob is a computer science student passionate about fashion, photography, and design. In 2021, he co-founded RIT Fabrick, a fashion club that brings together students from different majors and backgrounds to share their love for fashion. His experiences leading projects like runway shows and a fashion magazine inspired him to create <i>Models @ RIT</i>. He saw a need for a platform to connect photographers and aspiring models, as there was no easy way for students to collaborate on these kinds of projects. By combining his skills in software engineering and design, Jacob was able to bring this vision into a reality.
