    <h1>About</h1>
    <h3 class="left">
        Models @ RIT is a platform that connects photographers and aspiring models at RIT. Photography students often struggle to find models for their assignments and projects, while many students aspire to become models but lack the connections to do so.

    <h3 class="right">
        This website makes it easy for both photographers and models to connect. Any student with an rit.edu email can create a profile as a model, providing an opportunity to be seen and allowing photographers to use the site as a resource for discovering new faces.

                <b>Jacob Yoon, BS Computer Science '25</b><br><br>
                With passions in fashion, photography, and design, I co-founded RIT Fabrick, a fashion club that brings together students from different majors and backgrounds to share their passion for fashion. Through the club, I have met countless people with diverse backgrounds and participated in everything from photoshoots to fashion shows.<br><br>
                Through my experiences with RIT Fabrick, I saw a need for a platform like <i>Models @ RIT</i>. By combining my skills in software engineering and design, I was able to bring my vision into a reality.
